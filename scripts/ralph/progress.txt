## Codebase Patterns
- HTML files in root directory
- Assets in assets/ folder (css, js, images)
- Supabase for database and auth
- Netlify for hosting and serverless functions
- Logo path: assets/images/red_pine_logo.png
- Use Lucide icons, NO emojis anywhere
- Custom dropdowns instead of native selects
